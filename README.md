# Dice
## Layer of Fidelity
You might desire a different result from this library than others...

0. I don't care what I rolled on each die, just the results.
0. I care what I rolled on each die, but not the order I rolled them in.
0. I care what I rolled on each die and the order I rolled them in.

The library will only care about the third option for now.
Targeting the other options are only for efficiency in calculation.
Prefer quality of data to speed of calculation.
